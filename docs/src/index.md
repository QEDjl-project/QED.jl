# QED

This is the documentation for [QED](https://github.com/QEDjl-project/QED.jl). It represents the combination of the following subpackages:

**The two fundamental packages**:
- [QEDbase](https://github.com/QEDjl-project/QEDbase.jl): Interfaces and some functionality on abstract types. [Docs](https://qedjl-project.github.io/QEDbase.jl/stable/)
- [QEDcore](https://github.com/QEDjl-project/QEDcore.jl): Implementation of core functionality that is needed across all or most content packages. [Docs](https://qedjl-project.github.io/QEDcore.jl/stable/)

**The content packages**:
- [QEDprocesses](https://github.com/QEDjl-project/QEDprocesses.jl): Scattering process definitions, models, and calculation of cross-sections and probabilities. [Docs](https://qedjl-project.github.io/QEDprocesses.jl/stable/)
- [QEDevents](https://github.com/QEDjl-project/QEDevents.jl): Generation of random events for scattering processes. [Docs](https://qedjl-project.github.io/QEDevents.jl/stable/)
- [QEDfields](https://github.com/QEDjl-project/QEDfields.jl): Representation of background fields. [Docs](https://qedjl-project.github.io/QEDfields.jl/stable/)

For detailed information on the packages, please refer to their respective docs, linked above.
