This can be done by using the tagged PRs associated with this release.\n\n## Release procedure\n\n- [ ] Open a PR for merging `release-<version>` into the `main`-branch of the QEDjl-project repository with at least one reviewer who only needs to check the points above, the code additions were reviewed in the respective PRs. Do not delete the `release-<version>` branch yet. :warning: **Do not squash this PR, use a simple merge commit** :warning:\n- [ ] *After* the release branch is merged into `main`, open another PR for merging `release-<version>` into the `dev`-branch of the QEDjl-project repository. This can be merged without much review because the relevant changes were already reviewed in the PR `release-<version> -> main`. After this merge, you are free to delete the `release-<version>`-branch on your fork. :warning: **Do not squash this PR, use a simple merge commit** :warning:\n- [ ] Registration: Go to the issues and search for `Release`. There, write a comment with `<at>JuliaRegistrator register(branch=\"main\")` with a real `@` to trigger the registration bot opening a PR on Julia's general registry. \n- [ ] *After* the registration bot reports back the correct registration, tag the HEAD of `main` (which should still be the merge commit from the release branch merge) with `v<version>`. This will trigger a new deployment of the stable docs for the new version.\n- [ ] Build a GitHub release from the latest tagged commit on `main` and add the respective section from `CHANGELOG.md` to the release notes.","category":"page"},{"location":"ci/#Automatic-Testing","page":"Automatic Testing","title":"Automatic Testing","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"ci/","page":"Automatic Testing","title":"Automatic Testing","text":"In the QED.jl eco-system, we use Continuous integration (CIs) for running automatic tests.

This means in practice, the Project.toml of the project dep contains the dependency to orig. First, one should fork the package dep and checkout a new feature branch on this fork. The fix of the integration issue for dep is now developed on the feature branch. Once finished, the changes to dep are push to GitHub, and a pull request on dep is opened to check in the changes. By default, the unit test for dep should fail, because the CI in dep needs to use the modified version of orig. The solution for this problem is explained in the section Unit Test for CI Users. Using this, one should develop the fix on the feature branch until the CI of dep passes all unit tests. In this case, the original pull request in the upstream package orig can be resumed. Therefore, one needs to tell the CI of orig that the integration tests should use the fixed version package dep, which is still on the feature branch in a pull request on dep. In order to proceed, the CI on orig needs information on where the fix for dep is located.
